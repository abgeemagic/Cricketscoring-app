1. Team Management: Users can manage the batting and bowling teams, with functionality to switch between teams and update team names.
   
2. Score Tracking: The app keeps track of scores for both innings, including runs, wickets, overs, and ball counts. It updates the UI to reflect the current score dynamically.
   
3. Batter and Bowler Management: Users can select and update the current striker, non-striker, and bowler from lists of players. The app ensures the UI reflects these changes.
   
4. Extras and Wickets: The app provides options to add extras (e.g., runs from no-balls, wides) and to handle wickets, including updating the UI accordingly.
   
5. Over Management: The app manages the progression of overs, swapping strikers at the end of each over and ensuring the UI updates to reflect these changes.

6. UI Refresh Mechanism: To ensure the UI remains up-to-date with the latest state, the app employs a refresh mechanism using a key-based state update.
